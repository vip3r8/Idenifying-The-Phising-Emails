### [cite_start]Task for Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship [cite: 1, 2]

[cite_start]This repository contains the analysis and report for Task 2 of the Cyber Security Internship program[cite: 2].

---

## Objective

[cite_start]The primary objective of this task was to analyze a sample of a suspicious email to identify its phishing characteristics[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The final deliverable is a report that lists the phishing indicators discovered during the analysis[cite: 6].

## Methodology

To analyze the email, the following steps were taken, as suggested by the task guide:

* [cite_start]The sender's email address was examined for potential spoofing[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]The email headers were checked for discrepancies[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]The email body was scanned to identify suspicious links[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]The language used in the email was analyzed for urgent or threatening tones[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]Hyperlinks were inspected to find any mismatched URLs (where the displayed link differs from the actual destination)[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]The email content was checked for spelling or grammatical errors[cite: 15].

## Analysis of a Hypothetical Phishing Email

For this task, a hypothetical phishing email pretending to be from "Netflix Support" was analyzed.

* **Subject**: URGENT: Your Account will be Suspended!
* **Sender**: `support@accounts-netflix.com`

The analysis identified several key phishing indicators:
1.  **Sender Spoofing**: The email domain `accounts-netflix.com` is not an official Netflix domain and is designed to deceive the recipient.
2.  **Urgent Language**: The subject and body use threatening language like "URGENT" and "permanent account closure" to create panic.
3.  **Grammatical Errors**: The email contained errors such as "you're account" and "temporarilly," which are uncommon in official communications.
4.  **Malicious Link**: A link in the email was disguised to look like it led to `netflix.com`, but its actual destination was a suspicious, non-Netflix URL.

## Conclusion

The analysis conclusively determined that the email was a phishing attempt. It successfully combined multiple deceptive techniques to trick a user into revealing sensitive information. The key takeaway is the importance of carefully inspecting sender details, language, and links before trusting an email.

As a text-based AI, I am unable to generate an actual image or a screenshot.

However, I can create a detailed text-based representation of what that email would look like in an email client. This will give you a clear visual simulation to work with for your task.

From: Netflix Support <support@accounts-netflix.com> To: You <your.email@example.com> Date: October 21, 2025, 8:45 PM Subject: URGENT: Your Account will be Suspended!

Dear Valued Member,

We detected unusual activity on you're account. For your security, we have temporarilly suspended it.

To restore access, you must verify your billing details immediately. Failure to do so within 12 hours will result in permanent account closure.

Thank you,

This format shows you all the key elementsâ€”the deceptive sender, the urgent subject line, the grammatical errors, and the malicious linkâ€”just as you would see them in a real email client.
